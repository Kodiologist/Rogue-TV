Rogue TV is a nonviolent roguelike where you play a lucky contestant on a roguelike-themed game show. It's written in Hy_ with Python 2.

Currently, it's in a very early stage of development, and there isn't much to do.

Dependencies include Hy_, Kodhy_, Heidegger_, and libtcod_. Currently, curses is also a requirement. When (or rather, if) Rogue TV reaches a releasable state, I'll provide one-stop bundles with all dependencies, one for Unix-likes and one for Windows.

Start the game with ``hy roguetv/main.hy``.
